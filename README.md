# Variant Spells Rule for dnd5e

This module implements the [Variant Spell Points Rule](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#VariantSpellPoints) as described in the Dungeon Master's Guide. 

* Adds a Spell Point Tracking System to every Actor that is a spellcaster
  * Displays the remaining spell points etc. in the sheet header for easy access
* Replaces parts of the Spellbook in the sheet to show point costs and remaining uses
* Automatically resets Spellpoints on long rest and consumes them when a spell is used
* Works with multiclassing
* NPC's and non-spellcasters don't change
